The program takes in the members of family either by the command line or from
the already made documents. All necessary checks are being made in an attempt
to ensure file and data validity. After all family members are successfully
loaded or manually written, program gives a possibility to store acquired
data in a .dot file format for further use. Dot file is properly formatted,
so it can be used to create an image of family a tree.
